# Lab 5: Photo Bomb

In this assignment, you will build an entire web application, using Vue CLI for
the front end and Node, Express, and Mongo on the back end.

## Starting the Lab

To start the lab, you must follow this [GitHub Classroom link](https://classroom.github.com/a/MJD33cj0). This will create a private repository for you using our classroom site. We will only grade repositories created and submitted this way.

Once you "Accept the assignment" on GitHub Classroom, it will create a new repository for you and grant you access to it on GitHub. In order to start working on the lab, simply clone the repository to your laptop or other working environment.

## Tutorial

Use the [tutorials](/tutorials/README.md) to create the application. This will help you create an application for sharing photos, including user authentication,
uploading photos to a user's account, seeing all the photos in a user's account,
and showing all photos on the home page. Once you are done, the home page should
look like this:

![home page](/screenshots/homepage.png)

and a user's photo page should look like this:

![photo page](/screenshots/mypage4.png)

## Additional Functionality

Once you complete these introductory tutorials, add the following functionality:

- [Photo Page](/tutorials/part9.md)
- [Comments](/tutorials/part10.md)

## Link to GitHub repository

In a footer, you must include a link to your GitHub repository, which must be stored in GitHub Classroom.

## Submission

On Canvas, submit the URL for your website, which should be running on your DigitalOcean server.

## Rubric for Grading

When we grade these labs, we will award points using the following
rubric:
