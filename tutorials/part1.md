# Part 1: Vue Setup

```
nvm use stable
cd lab5
```

**For lab5, substitute your lab5 directory.**

Now run vue create:

```
vue create .
```

It will ask you some questions:

- _Generate project in current directory?_: **Y**

- _Please pick a preset_: **Router + Vuex + ESLint**

If you are missing the above-named preset, then you did not save it when you
worked on the [Learning the Vue CLI Lesson 1](https://github.com/BYU-CS-260-Winter-2019/learning-vue-cli/blob/master/tutorials/lesson1.md). Please choose **Manually
select features** and see the instructions there for configuring the project manually.

This creates a Vue CLI setup with Vue Router, Vuex, webpack, and linting.

Go to [Part 2](/tutorials/part2.md).
